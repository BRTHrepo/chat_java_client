# Project Brief

This project aims to develop a Java client application that facilitates communication with a chat server. The client will be built using **Java Swing** for the user interface and adhere to the **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)** architectural pattern for a clean separation of concerns.

## Core Requirements:
*   **User Interface:** A responsive and intuitive GUI using Java Swing.
*   **Communication:** Secure and efficient communication with the chat server via HTTP.
*   **Functionality:** User authentication, message sending and receiving, and potentially user profile management.
*   **Architecture:** Adherence to MVP principles, with distinct modules for core logic (`core`) and UI (`ui-swing`).
*   **Dependencies:** Utilize OkHttp for HTTP requests and Gson for JSON processing.
*   **Build Management:** Employ Maven for project and dependency management.

## Project Goals:
*   To provide a robust and user-friendly chat client.
*   To establish a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
*   To ensure reliable communication between the client and server.

## Scope:
The initial scope focuses on the core chat functionality, including user login and basic messaging. Future iterations may expand on features like group chats, file sharing, and advanced user management.
