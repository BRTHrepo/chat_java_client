# Active Context

This file tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions related to the project.

## Current Work Focus:
Initializing the Memory Bank structure by creating and populating its core Markdown files.

## Recent Changes:
*   Created `projectBrief.md` and `productContext.md`.

## Next Steps:
*   Continue populating the remaining core Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
*   Define initial content for `systemPatterns.md` based on the MVP architecture and `docs/java_client_plan.md`.
*   Define initial content for `techContext.md` based on the technologies listed in `docs/java_client_plan.md`.
*   Define initial content for `progress.md` based on the `PROGRESS.md` file and the current state of the project setup.

## Active Decisions & Considerations:
*   Ensuring all core Memory Bank files are created and populated with relevant information from existing documentation.
*   Maintaining consistency in the structure and content of Memory Bank files.

## Project Insights:
*   The Memory Bank is crucial for maintaining project knowledge across sessions due to the AI's stateless nature.
