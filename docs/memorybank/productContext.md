# Product Context

This project exists to provide a robust and user-friendly Java client application for interacting with a chat server. The primary goal is to enable seamless and secure communication between users.

## Why This Project Exists:
The need for a dedicated, well-structured client application arises from the desire to offer a superior user experience compared to generic web clients or command-line interfaces. This project aims to leverage modern Java development practices to create a maintainable, scalable, and feature-rich application.

## Problems It Solves:
*   **Lack of a dedicated client:** Provides a native desktop application for chat, offering better performance and integration possibilities than web-based solutions.
*   **Complex communication:** Simplifies interaction with the chat server through a well-defined API and efficient HTTP/JSON handling.
*   **Maintainability and Scalability:** The MVP architecture and modular design (`core` and `ui-swing`) ensure the codebase is easy to understand, modify, and extend.
*   **User Experience:** Delivers an intuitive and responsive interface through Java Swing, making chat accessible and efficient for users.

## User Experience Goals:
*   **Intuitive Interface:** Users should be able to easily navigate and use the application without a steep learning curve, thanks to the Java Swing GUI.
*   **Seamless Communication:** Real-time message exchange should be smooth and reliable.
*   **Security:** User authentication and data transmission should be secure.
*   **Performance:** The application should be responsive, with minimal lag in UI interactions and message handling.
